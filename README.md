## Data for benchmarking tumor-immune deconvolution methods vs. canonical marker proteins

This repo contains a dataset for use in benchmarking tumor-immune deconvolution methods. 

#### Data:
For five non-small cell lung cancer FFPE tumors, 20+ regions of interest were identified per tumor. 
In adjacent sections from each tumor, the GeoMx protein assay and the GeoMx RNA assay were run on matching regions. 
In each region, pure tumor (PanCK+ stain) and pure microenvironment(PanCK-) segments were collected separately. 

This dataset was collected to allow comparison of immune deconvolution results from the RNA data to expression of canonical marker proteins. 

For a full description of this dataset, see Danaher & Kim et al. (2020), "Advances in mixed cell deconvolution enable quantification of cell types in spatially-resolved gene expression data."
